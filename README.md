# RubbishCollector

## 1) Project Description: ##
Initial idea is based around a turtle-bot following a straight line (which will act as a kerb, for example) while the attached Dobot with an end effector gripper picks-ups/sorts blocks (which acts as garbage) to envision a garbage collection operation. Computer vision will be used to move the Turtlebot and possibly pick up the blocks as well.


## 2) Robot (Cyton/Dobot) and End-effector you wish to use and the reason (100 words). ##

We planned on using the Dobot because it has a greater variety of grippers. Since we're planning on grasping some objects that will act as rubbish, we are not limited only to blocks, since with different grippers we might be able to grasp different types of objects with random shapes. Other than that, it's more precise than the Cyton robot and that might be really useful since we'll have a mobile base that might increase uncertanty at some point of the project.
